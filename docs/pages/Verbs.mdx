# ● Verbs

For example, let's look at the Verb `Ship`.  A Verb defines a relationships between a `Subject` and an `Object`:

```yaml
Shipper.ships: Shipment
```

In this case, `Shipper` is the Subject that is performing the `Verb` to the `Object`

An `Action` is an instance of `Resource` performing the `Verb` to the `Object` like:

```yaml
Amazon.ships: Order\abc123
```

You can also express metadata on the `Verb`:

```yaml
Shipper.ships:
  shipment: Shipment
  from: Origin
  to: Destination
  with: Provider
```

There are multiple tenses of the Verb `Ship`:

  - Activity: `Shipping`
  - Event: `Ship`
  - Action: `Ships`
  - State: `Shipped`

```yaml
Shipping:
  _subject: Shipper
  _event: Ship
  _action: Ships
  _activity: Shipping
  _state: Shipped
  _object: Shipment
  from: Origin
  to: Destination
  with: Provider
  asn: EDI.AdvancedShipmentNotice
  bol: EDI.BillOfLading
```

## Activity

The `Activity` is otherwise known as the gerund, or Noun form of the Verb.  This is is typically formed by adding `-ing` to the base Verb.
