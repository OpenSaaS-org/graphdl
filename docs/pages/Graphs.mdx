# ■● Graphs

A Graph is a collection of Nouns and Verbs.  The Nouns are the things and the Verbs are the relationships between them.

## Defining a Graph

The simple syntax for defining a Graph is:

```yaml
${_icon} ${_name}: ${_description} (${_type})
```

So this example:

```yaml
☁️ SaaS: Software as a Service (WebApplication)
```
