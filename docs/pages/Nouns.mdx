# ‚ñ† Nouns

Nouns are the things in a [Graph](/Nouns/Graph).  Every [Noun](/Nouns/Noun)
has [Properties](/Properties) that describe its attributes.
[Nouns](/Nouns/Noun) relate to each other through [Verbs](/Verbs).
[Triggers](/Triggers) are the potential [Events](/Events) that can
happen to a [Noun](/Nouns/Noun). A [Resource](/Nouns/Resource) is a specific
instance of a [Noun](/Nouns/Noun).

## Defining a Noun

The simple syntax for defining a Noun is:

```yaml
${_icon} ${_name}: ${_description} (${_type})
```

So this example:

```yaml
‚òÅÔ∏è SaaS: Software as a Service (WebApplication)
```

Is the same as the full syntax:

```yaml [[6, 0-100, https://schema.org]]
SaaS:
  _id: saas
  _name: SaaS
  _icon: ‚òÅÔ∏è
  _description: Software as a Service
  _type: https://schema.org/WebApplication
```

## Internal Properties

Properties that start with an underscore (`_`) are internal properties of a noun that
provide semantic and functional information about the Noun.

### `_id`

The `_id` property is the unique identifier for the Noun.  It is used to
reference the Noun in other parts of the Graph.  It is also used to
generate the URL for the Noun's representation in the App, API, Site, and Docs.

```yaml {2}
SaaS:
  _id: saas
  _name: SaaS
  _icon: ‚òÅÔ∏è
  _description: Software as a Service
  _type: https://schema.org/WebApplication
```

### `_name`

The `_name` property is the name of the Noun.  It is used to generate the
human-readable title of the Noun's representation in the App, API, Site, and Docs.


```yaml {3}
SaaS:
  _id: saas
  _name: SaaS
  _icon: ‚òÅÔ∏è
  _description: Software as a Service
  _type: https://schema.org/WebApplication
```

### `_icon`

The `_icon` property is the icon of the Noun.  It provides the visual representation 
of the Noun in the App, API, Site, and Docs.


```yaml {4}
SaaS:
  _id: saas
  _name: SaaS
  _icon: ‚òÅÔ∏è
  _description: Software as a Service
  _type: https://schema.org/WebApplication
```

### `_description`

The `_description` property is the description of the Noun.  It is used to generate the
human-readable description of the Noun's representation in the App, API, Site, and Docs.


```yaml {5}
SaaS:
  _id: saas
  _name: SaaS
  _icon: ‚òÅÔ∏è
  _description: Software as a Service
  _type: https://schema.org/WebApplication
```

### `_type`

The `_type` property is the base class that Noun inherits from.  It can be another Noun 
in the Graph, a Noun that was [imported], the name or URL of the [Thing](/Nouns/Thing) on Schema.org, 
or the URL of any JSON Schema or TypeScript Type.  All Properties on the base Noun are
inherited by the Noun.


```yaml {6}
SaaS:
  _id: saas
  _name: SaaS
  _icon: ‚òÅÔ∏è
  _description: Software as a Service
  _type: https://schema.org/WebApplication
```

### `_sameAs`

The `_sameAs` property is the URL of the Noun's representation in Schema.org.  It provides
the synonymous or canonical representation of the Noun without inheriting any of the
properties of the referenced Noun. This is useful for defining Nouns where you don't want
to inherit all of the properties of the referenced Noun.

```yaml {6}
SaaS:
  _id: saas
  _name: SaaS
  _icon: ‚òÅÔ∏è
  _description: Software as a Service
  _sameAs: https://schema.org/WebApplication
```

### `_source`

The `_source` property is the URL of the Noun's source data.  A Noun with a `_source` property
implies it is a read-only Noun in a Graph, so it's resources cannot be modified.  It is useful for defining
Nouns with Resources that are imported from external sources.

```yaml {3}
Country:
  _plural: Countries
  _source: https://json.fyi/countries.json
  _id:     cca2
  _name:   name.common
  _icon:   üåé
```

### `_seed`

The `_seed` property is the URL of the Noun's seed data.  A Noun with a `_seed` property
gets its initial Resources seeded from the data at the URL, but Resources can be created, updated,
and deleted.

```yaml {3}
Product:
  _id:   entityId
  _name: productName
  _seed: https://json.fyi/northwind/products.json
```

## Calculated Properties

### Property References

Properties can be calculated by referencing other properties in the Noun like `_id: iata` 

```yaml {2}
Colo:
 _id:     iata
 _source: https://speed.cloudflare.com/locations
 iata:    string
 ```

### String Literals

Properties can be calculated by using string literals like `_name: ${iata} - ${city}, ${cca2}, ${region}`

 ```yaml {2}
Colo:
 _name:   ${iata} - ${city}, ${cca2}, ${region}
 _source: https://speed.cloudflare.com/locations
 ```

### JavaScript Functions

Calculated Properties can be written JavaScript expressions like `Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30`

```yaml {2}
Cache:
  expires: Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30
```

Schema.org was created by Google, Microsoft, and other search engines as way to standardize the way that 
data is structured on the web.
