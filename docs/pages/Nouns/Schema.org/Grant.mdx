# Grant

A grant, typically financial or otherwise quantifiable, of resources. Typically a <a class="localLink" href="/funder">funder</a> sponsors some <a class="localLink" href="/MonetaryAmount">MonetaryAmount</a> to an <a class="localLink" href="/Organization">Organization</a> or <a class="localLink" href="/Person">Person</a>,
    sometimes not necessarily via a dedicated or long-lived <a class="localLink" href="/Project">Project</a>, resulting in one or more outputs, or <a class="localLink" href="/fundedItem">fundedItem</a>s. For financial sponsorship, indicate the <a class="localLink" href="/funder">funder</a> of a <a class="localLink" href="/MonetaryGrant">MonetaryGrant</a>. For non-financial support, indicate <a class="localLink" href="/sponsor">sponsor</a> of <a class="localLink" href="/Grant">Grant</a>s of resources (e.g. office space).<br/><br/>

Grants support  activities directed towards some agreed collective goals, often but not always organized as <a class="localLink" href="/Project">Project</a>s. Long-lived projects are sometimes sponsored by a variety of grants over time, but it is also common for a project to be associated with a single grant.<br/><br/>

The amount of a <a class="localLink" href="/Grant">Grant</a> is represented using <a class="localLink" href="/amount">amount</a> as a <a class="localLink" href="/MonetaryAmount">MonetaryAmount</a>.
