Multiple of these entities can be used to represent different shipping rates for different destinations:<br/><br/>

One entity for Alaska/Hawaii. A different one for continental US. A different one for all France.<br/><br/>

Multiple of these entities can be used to represent different shipping costs and delivery times.<br/><br/>

Two entities that are identical but differ in rate and time:<br/><br/>

or Fast and expensive: $15 in 1-2 days.
