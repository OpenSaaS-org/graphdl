# EndorsementRating

An EndorsementRating is a rating that expresses some level of endorsement, for example inclusion in a "critic's pick" blog, a
"Like" or "+1" on a social network. It can be considered the <a class="localLink" href="/result">result</a> of an <a class="localLink" href="/EndorseAction">EndorseAction</a> in which the <a class="localLink" href="/object">object</a> of the action is rated positively by
some <a class="localLink" href="/agent">agent</a>. As is common elsewhere in schema.org, it is sometimes more useful to describe the results of such an action without explicitly describing the <a class="localLink" href="/Action">Action</a>.<br/><br/>

An <a class="localLink" href="/EndorsementRating">EndorsementRating</a> may be part of a numeric scale or organized system, but this is not required: having an explicit type for indicating a positive,
endorsement rating is particularly useful in the absence of numeric scales as it helps consumers understand that the rating is broadly positive.
