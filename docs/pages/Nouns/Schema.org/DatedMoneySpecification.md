# DatedMoneySpecification

A DatedMoneySpecification represents monetary values with optional start and end dates. For example, this could represent an employee's salary over a specific period of time. <strong>Note:</strong> This type has been superseded by <Link href="/MonetaryAmount">MonetaryAmount</Link>, use of that type is recommended.
