# State

The `_state` property on a Noun represents a Finite State Machine while the `state` of a Resource is it's current State.

```yaml
Switch:
  _state:
    initial: inactive
    states:
      inactive:
        on:
          toggle: active
      active:
        on:
          toggle: inactive
```

The syntax of `_state` is based on [XState](https://xstate.js.org) and can be [visualized](https://stately.ai/viz) and 
[edited](https://stately.ai/registry/new) with [Stately](https://stately.ai)
