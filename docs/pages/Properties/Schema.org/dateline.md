# dateline

A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline">dateline</Link> is a brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only a placename is provided.<br/><br/>

Structured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using <Link href="/locationCreated">locationCreated</a> (which represents where a work was created, e.g. where a news report was written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use <a class="localLink" href="/contentLocation">contentLocation</a>.<br/><br/>

Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples: "BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.", "Paris, France", "December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington", "Beijing/Moscow", "QUEZON CITY, Philippines".
