# eventSchedule

Associates an <a class="localLink" href="/Event">Event</a> with a <a class="localLink" href="/Schedule">Schedule</a>. There are circumstances where it is preferable to share a schedule for a series of
      repeating events rather than data on the individual events themselves. For example, a website or application might prefer to publish a schedule for a weekly
      gym class rather than provide data on every event. A schedule could be processed by applications to add forthcoming events to a calendar. An <a class="localLink" href="/Event">Event</a> that
      is associated with a <a class="localLink" href="/Schedule">Schedule</a> using this property should not have <a class="localLink" href="/startDate">startDate</a> or <a class="localLink" href="/endDate">endDate</a> properties. These are instead defined within the associated
      <a class="localLink" href="/Schedule">Schedule</a>, this avoids any ambiguity for clients using the data. The property might have repeated values to specify different schedules, e.g. for different months
      or seasons.
