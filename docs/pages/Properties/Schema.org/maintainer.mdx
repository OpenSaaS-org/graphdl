A maintainer is a <a class="localLink" href="/Person">Person</a> or <a class="localLink" href="/Organization">Organization</a> that manages contributions to, and/or publication of, some (typically complex) artifact. It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on "upstream" sources.

The <a class="localLink" href="/isBasedOn">isBasedOn</a> property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work.
