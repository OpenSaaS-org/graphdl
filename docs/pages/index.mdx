[GraphDL.js] translates the [GraphDL Schema] into a [Javascript ES6 Module] with [Typescript Types], 
as well as optionally [JSON Schema], [OpenAPI Spec], [GraphQL Schema], and a [React Admin UI].

The generated [Javascript] and [Typescript] code includes the base data models, as well as [Validation] logic, 
[List], [Search], [Create], [Update], & [Delete] logic for client and/or server side use, including APIs, 

That can be deployed anywhere including [Cloudflare Workers], [Deno Deploy], [Fly.io], [AWS], [Azure], [GCP] 
or with self-hosted containers

## ■● Graph

A [Graph] is a collection of [Nouns] and [Verbs] that describe the relationships between [Nouns].

## ■ Noun

A [Noun] is a person, place, thing, or idea.

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User:
  name: string
  email: email
  has: [ToDo]
```

Additionally, every [Noun] has internal properties that are prefixed with an underscore like `_icon` and `_description`.

```yaml
User:
  _icon: 🧑‍💻
  _description: The User of an App
  name: string
  email: email
  has: [ToDo]
```

Every [Noun] in GraphDL is a [Thing] in Schema.org, and a noun can specify the Schema.org type it represents 
with the `sameAs` property:

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User:
  _sameAs: https://schema.org/Person
  name: string
  email: email
  has: [ToDo]
```

GraphDL also supports a shorthand for specifying the `_icon`, `_name`, `_description` and `_sameAs` properties:

```yaml
'{_icon} {_name}': '{_description} ({_sameAs})'
```

For example, this code:

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User: The User of an App (Person)
```

is equivalent to this code:

```yaml
user:
  _id: user
  _icon: 🧑‍💻
  _name: User
  _description: The User of an App
  _sameAs: https://schema.org/Person
```

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User:
  _sameAs: Person
  name: string
  email: email
  has: [ToDo]
```

Schema.org was created by Google, Microsoft, and other search engines as way to standardize the way that data is structured on the web.

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User: Person
```

## ● Verb

A [Verb] connects a [Noun] to a different [Noun], and is expressed as `[Subject].[Verb]: [Object]`.

For example, in `User.subscribes: App` the verb `subscribes` connects the [Subject] `User` to the [Object] `App`.

## □ Resource

A [Resource] is a specific instance of a [Noun]

## ○ Action

An [Action] happens when an instance of a [Noun] (i.e. [Resource]) does a [Verb] to a different [Resource].

For example, in `User/john.subscribes: App/ToDos` the verb `subscribes` connects the [Subject Resource] `User/john` to the [Object Resource] `App/ToDos`.

## ◆ Trigger

A [Trigger] invokes an [Action] on a [Schedule], when a [Resource] is created, modified, or deleted, or when an [Action] happens.

## ◇ Event

An [Event] happens whenever a [Trigger] happening at a specific point in time, and can occur at scheduled times, whenever a [Resource] is created, updated, or deleted, or whenever an [Action] happens.

## ⧆ Query

A [Query] is the input criteria for a [Search] in a [Graph] that may or may not be constrained to a specific [Noun] or [Verb]

## ⊛ Search

A [Search] is as [Action] that returns a list of [Resources] that match a specific [Query].

## 入 API

An [API] is a [Function] that can be passed [Data] via a [Request] and returns [Data] in a [Response].

## ❴❵ Data

[Data] is the information that is stored in a [Resource] in a JSON format.

## ❪❫ Function

A [Function] is Javascript code that can be placed on a [Verb] is executed when an [Action] happens.

## ❮❯ UI

A [UI] is JSX code that can be placed on a [Noun] and is executed when a [Resource] is rendered.

## ☶ Site

A [Site] is a publicly-accesible [UI] and can be deployed to the cloud, and run in the cloud, at the edge, or in a browser

## ⧉ App

An [App] is an composition of [UI] powered by [APIs] with [Users] and [Tenants], and that can be deployed to the cloud, and run in the cloud, at the edge, in a browser, or on a device.
