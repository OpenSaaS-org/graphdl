JavaScript code is a native part of GraphDL, and GraphDL Schema is transpiled into a 
[JavaScript Module](/nouns) with full [TypeScript](/nouns) support. 
[JSON Schema](/nouns), [OpenAPI](/nouns), [GraphQL](/nouns), a [Website](/nouns), 
a [React Admin App](/nouns), and [Documentation](/nouns) can also be optionally generated.

The generated [Javascript](/#) and [Typescript](/#) code includes the base data models, as well as [Validation](/#) logic, 
[List](/#), [Search](/#), [Create](/#), [Update](/#), & [Delete](/#) logic for client and/or server side use, including APIs, 

That can be deployed anywhere including [Cloudflare Workers](/#), [Deno Deploy](/#), [Fly.io](/#), [AWS](/#), [Azure](/#), [GCP](/#)
or with self-hosted containers

## ‚ñ†‚óè Graph

A [Graph](/#Graph) is a collection of [Nouns](/#Noun) and [Verbs](/#Verb) that describe the relationships between [Nouns](/#Noun).

## ‚ñ† Noun

A [Noun](/#Noun) is a person, place, thing, or idea and has [Properties](/#Properties) that describe it.

```yaml
Customer
  name: string
  email: email
  phone: phone
  notes: markdown
```

## ‚óè Verb

A [Verb](/verbs/verb) connects a [Noun](/nouns/noun) to a different [Noun](/#Noun), and is expressed as `[Subject].[Verb]: [Object]`.

For example, in `User.subscribes: App` the verb `subscribes` connects the [Subject](/#) `User` to the [Object](/#) `App`.

## ‚à∑ Property

A [Property](/Properties/Property) are the attributes that describe a [Noun](/nouns/noun) or [Verb](/verbs/verb). 
[Properties](/nouns/properties) that start with and underscore (`_`) like [`_type`](/properties/_type), 
[`_sameAs`](/properties/_sameAs), or [`_icon`](/properties/_icon) or mean that they are internal properties that
that describe the [Noun](/nouns/noun) or [Verb](/verbs/verb) and cannot be changed on any given 
[Resource](/nouns/resource) with the exception of `_id` which must be unique for every [Resource](/nouns/resource).

## ‚ñ° Resource

A [Resource](/nouns/resource) is a specific instance of a [Noun](/nouns/noun) and can be stored or
transmitted in JSON as [Data](/nouns/data)

For example, in `User/john` the [Resource](/nouns/resource) is `john` and the [Noun](/nouns/noun) is `User`.

```json
{
  "_type": "User",
  "_id": "john",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

## ‚óã Action

An [Action] happens when an instance of a [Noun] (i.e. [Resource]) does a [Verb] to a different [Resource].

For example, in `User/john.subscribes: App/ToDos` the verb `subscribes` connects the [Subject Resource] `User/john` to the [Object Resource] `App/ToDos`.

## ‚óÜ Trigger

A [Trigger] invokes an [Action] on a [Schedule], when a [Resource] is created, modified, or deleted, or when an [Action] happens.

## ‚óá Event

An [Event] happens whenever a [Trigger] happening at a specific point in time, and can occur at scheduled times, whenever a [Resource] is created, updated, or deleted, or whenever an [Action] happens.

## ‚ßÜ Query

A [Query] is the input criteria for a [Search] in a [Graph] that may or may not be constrained to a specific [Noun] or [Verb]

## ‚äõ Search

A [Search] is as [Action] that returns a list of [Resources] that match a specific [Query].

## ÂÖ• API

An [API] is a [Function] that can be passed [Data] via a [Request] and returns [Data] in a [Response].

## ‚¨Æ Integration

An [Integration] connects a [Graph] to a third-party [Provider] and can be used with [Triggers], [Searches], and [Actions] data.

## ‚¨Ø Provider

A [Provider] is a third-party service that can be connected to a [Graph] via an [Integration].

## ‚ù¥‚ùµ Data

[Data] is the information that is stored in a [Resource] in a JSON format.

## ‚ù™‚ù´ Function

A [Function] is Javascript code that can be placed on a [Verb] is executed when an [Action] happens.

## ‚ùÆ‚ùØ UI

A [UI] is JSX code that can be placed on a [Noun] and is executed when a [Resource] is rendered.

## ‚ò∂ Site

A [Site] is a publicly-accesible [UI] and can be deployed to the cloud, and run in the cloud, at the edge, or in a browser

## ‚ßâ App

An [App] is an composition of [UI] powered by [APIs] with [Users] and [Tenants], and that can be deployed to the cloud, and run in the cloud, at the edge, in a browser, or on a device.

## ‚ñº Role

A [Role] describes the relationship between a [User] and a [Tenant] with specific [Permissions] relating to [Resources] and [Actions] on a [Graph].

## ‚ñΩ User

A [User] is a person who has a [Role] in a [Tenant] and can access [Resources] and perform [Actions] in a [Graph].

## ‚ñ≥ Tenant

A [Tenant] is a business or organization that has a [Role] in a [Graph] and can access [Resources] and perform [Actions] in a [Graph].

## ‚ü¢ Request

A [Request] is a message sent from a [Client] to a [Server] containing [Data] and [Headers].

## ‚ü£ Response

A [Response] is a message sent from a [Server] to a [Client] containing [Data] and [Headers].
