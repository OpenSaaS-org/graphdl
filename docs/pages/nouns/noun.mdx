# ■ Noun

A [Noun] is a person, place, thing, or idea.

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User:
  name: string
  email: email
  has: [ToDo]
```

Additionally, every [Noun] has internal properties that are prefixed with an underscore like `_icon` and `_description`.

```yaml
User:
  _icon: 🧑‍💻
  _description: The User of an App
  name: string
  email: email
  has: [ToDo]
```

Every [Noun] in GraphDL is a [Thing] in Schema.org, and a noun can specify the Schema.org type it represents 
with the `sameAs` property:

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User:
  _sameAs: https://schema.org/Person
  name: string
  email: email
  has: [ToDo]
```

GraphDL also supports a shorthand for specifying the `_icon`, `_name`, `_description` and `_sameAs` properties:

```yaml
'{_icon} {_name}': '{_description} ({_sameAs})'
```

For example, this code:

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User: The User of an App (Person)
```

is equivalent to this code:

```yaml
user:
  _id: user
  _icon: 🧑‍💻
  _name: User
  _description: The User of an App
  _sameAs: https://schema.org/Person
```

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User:
  _sameAs: Person
  name: string
  email: email
  has: [ToDo]
```

Schema.org was created by Google, Microsoft, and other search engines as way to standardize the way that data is structured on the web.

```yaml
🧑‍💻 User: Person
```
