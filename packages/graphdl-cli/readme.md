# GraphDL CLI

it's easy to get started:


```bash
npx graphdl 
```

By default, the CLI will search the current directory for files matching `*.graphdl` or `graphdl.*`  and generate `.js` and `.json` files in the same directory.

```bash
npx graphdl schemas/*.graphdl --out dist
```

```bash
npx graphdl --watch
```
