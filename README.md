# GraphDL
Graph Definition Language Specification

## Features

- Supports both Strong and Dynamic Types
- Automatically Generates Reverse Edges
- Supports Option Cascading Updates & Deletes
- Generates Types & Interfaces for all languages including Typescript
- Generates Hypermedia-Driven (HATEOAS) RESTful APIs
- Generates OpenAPI Specification documents
- Generates GraphQL Schemas & Automatic Resolvers
- Has VSCode Plugin for Syntax Linting (and reverse edge creation)

GraphDL is based on TypeScript
```
type User: Person = {
  id: 'id'
  firstName: 'string'
  lastName: 'string'
  email: 'email'
  phone: 'telephone'
  knows: 'User.knows'
  children: 'User.parents'
  parents: 'User.children'
}
```


```
import { id, email, telephone, Person } from 'graphdl'

type User: Person = {
  id: id
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  email: email
  phone: telephone
  knows: User.email
}
```



Nodes are created with a schema definition using schemas and properties from Schema.org:
```
type: 
  name: User
  type: Person
  props: 
    - id: identifier
    - firstName: givenName
    - lastName: familyName
    - email: email
    - phone: telephone
    - knows: User.email
```

This allows much more flexibility by enabling types and props to any shape vs. rigid JSONLD objects with a @context of Schema.org, but has the ability to transform any object in this definition language into a valid Schema.org JSONLD Object.

If you want to reference a type that is outside of Schema.
```
  type: Person
```

Schema relationships are described with schema property value of `[TypeName.propName]` of the related entity type
```
    - knows: User.email
```

By specifying simple directional relationships: 
```
Thing.relationshipType -> AnotherThing.hasTypes
```

The reverse edges are created automatically:

```
AnotherThing.hasTypes <- Thing.relationshipType
```

Using these schemas, Typescript Types, OpenAPI Specs, and GraphQL Schemas can be generated.
